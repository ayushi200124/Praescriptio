# Praescriptio
A final year full stack Data Science Project based on Predictive Model and Image processing. The features include:
- Predict 42 common diseases based on any 5 prominent symptoms among the 132 common symptoms given in the dataset. 
- Get to know if you are affected with Malaria using your red blood cell image, among two classes: Infected and Uninfected. 
- Classify the brain MRI reports into 4 classes: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary and No-Tumour. Later Segment the brain tumours.
- Classify the lungs X-Ray reports into 3 classes: Covid-19, Pneumonia and Normal.
# Implementation of Problem
System Specification used to develop the application
1. Laptop Configuration: Windows, core i5 10th generation, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard disk.
2. Browser: Google Chrome
3. Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
4. Model Datasets: Kaggle Datasets, Excel Spreadsheets
5. Database: SQL Lite
6. Framework: Flask (Python)
7. Models training: Jupyter Notebook
8. Frontend: html, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Google Maps.
# Applicationâ€™s Directory Structure
1. app.py: main flask application where server runs. 
2. Brain_Tumor_Classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to train Brain Tumor Model
3. Brain_Tumor_Segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to train Brain Tumor Model
4. Diseasepredictipn.py: Python file to train Common Diseases Model
5. Forms.py: Form for user registration, login and contact
6. Malaria-Detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to train Malaria Model
7. model_classifcation.h5: Saved weights of Brain MRI Model [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D12RTGCWFYKQ-IcELjUUCth0obzqfu4m/view?usp=sharing)
8. model_segmentation.h5: Saved weights of Brain MRI Model [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ox0f0TkTPpnCrzWrs_AAluTJDsxwIzpo/view?usp=sharing)
9. model111.h5: Saved weights of Pneumonia-Covid19 Model
10. my_model.h5: Saved weights of Malaria Model
11. Pneumonia-Detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to train Pneumonia-Covid19 Model
12. _pycache_: This is the folder where the interpreter compiles python code to byte code first (this 
is an oversimplification) and stores it.
13. Brain Dataset: Folder having both the classification and segmentation dataset of Brain Tumor.
14. dataset: Folder having the labeled dataset for common disease prediction.
15. static: Folder containing all the CSS, JS, Bootstrap components and Frontend Animations.
16. templates: Folder containing all the html files to run the application on web.
17. uploads: Folder containing all the uploaded images being given by end-users during testing the 
models.
